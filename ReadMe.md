Asclepius is a medical record management system for the students of Bennett University. It is a desktop application built using Python and Custom Tkinter. It allows the students to view available medicines at the University's Wellness center, look the medicine's details, check the availability of the medicine, and request for it. It also allows the students to order medicines from the Wellness center to their hostel rooms.
